---

- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
- HTML describes the structure of a web page's content
- HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language
- HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages and are represented by tags


## HTML Document Structure

- `<DOCTYPE html>`
    - The DOCTYPE element must be the very first non-comment tag declared in our HTML document, even before the <html> tag.

    - It is not an HTML tag, it is an instruction to the browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

- `<html>`
    - Root tag of an HTML document.

    - Used as a container for all of the HTML within the document.

- `<head>`
    - Contains information about the HTML document that is used by browsers and web crawlers but is not displayed to web site visitors.

- `<body>`
    - Contains the entire content of a webpage which will be rendered on the user's screen.
    
    - Must be the second element inside of the parent `<html>` element, following only the `<head>` element.
