        <h1>Iframes</h1>

        <p>
            An iframe is like a little window that has been placed into
            your webpage. The term iframe is an abbreviation for "inline
            frame".
        </p>

        <p>
            One common use of iframes is to embed Google Maps into the
            webpage. The content of the iframe can be any HTML page 
            (either located on the web servers or external sites).
        </p>

        <iframe 
            src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3520.5739117041326!2d-82.42700934935252!3d28.068031816070167!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88c2c79893ff8725%3A0x5d7c5bad3ede5e76!2sNorthwest%20Education%20Complex%2C%20Tampa%2C%20FL%2033613!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1568395307858!5m2!1sen!2sus" 
            width="600" height="450" 
            frameborder="0" style="border:0;" 
            allowfullscreen="">
        </iframe>

        <br/><br/><br/>

        <p>
            Another common use for iframes is to embed videos into a page.
            Video content is often included to support other content on page.
        </p>

        <iframe 
            width="560" height="315" 
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2ByLmLnYJ8" 
            frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
            allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>

        <p>
            This works fine if you have an externally hosted video. However,
            if I have my own video content that is located on the same web
            server as this document, then the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag to 
            accomplish this.
